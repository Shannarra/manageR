# Future development

This is a list of features left for future development:

1. Mass user imports
 Allows imports via a CSV/XLSX file in the admin panel.
2. Extended institution settings
 Extend the institution functionality by adding extendable and customizable settings.
 Those settings will allow extending or disabling of functionality based on the institution's plan/contract with the system.

 Some of the settings planned include, but are not limited to:
 * Information encryption settings - let the institution chose the level of encryption and control they would like to have on their data.
 * Extended expiry - controls for how long certain information such as reports, attendances and grades is kept. Default would be several years, depending on the institution's country.
 * Extended user modifications - change the way institutions handle users based on their preferences, including modifications to user profiles, extendability, etc.
3. Subject enrollment
 Allow users to choose the subjects they want to study IF the institution allows it.
4. More report variations
 Reports can have variations for time span - monthly, weekly, yearly.
 They encapsulate all data for the given time span in the requested format.
5. Multitenancy
 Incorporate multitenancy on the project, allowing complete separation of institutions and their data.

All aforementioned points are NOT chronological and will be tackled according to their priority, which will be set after discussions with users and stakeholders.
